This website is part of a project I am working on as a fellow in the [Open Science Fellow Program](https://wikimedia.de/wiki/Fellowprogramm). In my work as biologist, I am dealing with (fossil) amphibians, extinction risk and the potential factors influencing this risk. This webpage shows the process of analysing data and stats behind the fassade of a finished paper.

On this page you find work in progress.
