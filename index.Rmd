This website is part of a project I am working on as a fellow in the [Open Science Fellow Program](https://wikimedia.de/wiki/Fellowprogramm). In my work as biologist, I am dealing with (fossil) amphibians, extinction risk and the potential factors influencing this risk. This webpage shows the process of analysing data and stats behind the fassade of a finished paper.

On this page you find work in progress.

Please note that this webpage is as well part of my project, therefore it is also my GitHub and GitHub Pages playground. Please don`t mind if things are under construction.
