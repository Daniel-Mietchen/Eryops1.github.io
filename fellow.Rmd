I created this website as part of my work in the [Open Science Fellow Program](https://wikimedia.de/wiki/BildungWissenschaftKultur/Fellowprogramm/Fellows). Open Science needs communication, and what better way could there be than making your science explorable online? While learning to use GitHub, I stumbled across GitHub Pages, which resulted in this webpage.
