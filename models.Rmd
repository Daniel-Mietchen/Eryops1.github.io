This page is the heart of my current work. It shows the basic steps of how I select a model for my data to correlate duration and species traits.

# Data
As the dataset itself contains some highly skewed variables and also missing data, I test several types of models to find one that fits the data best.

```{r, child="_sessioninfo.Rmd"}
```
